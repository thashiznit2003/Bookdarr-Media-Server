# Handoff — Bookdarr Media Server (BMS)

## Current Status
- Repo initialized with NestJS scaffold.
- Docs updated for new agent handoff.
- Settings module added (env parsing + redacted `/settings` endpoint).
- Test scripts disable experimental webstorage to avoid Node warnings.
- Basic admin UI placeholder added at `/` (HTML + fetches `/settings`).
- Diagnostics endpoint added (`POST /diagnostics`) that pushes payloads to the diagnostics repo.
- Auth module added with invite-only signup, JWT access/refresh, and password reset via SMTP (SQLite/Postgres storage via TypeORM).
- Diagnostics endpoint now requires auth when JWT secrets are configured.
- e2e tests cover auth-required diagnostics and README now includes login + diagnostics curl flow.
- First-run setup wizard added for initial user creation (GET/POST `/auth/setup`).
- Book Pool library endpoint added (`GET /library`) with Open Library enrichment and Plex-inspired UI.
- Added Ubuntu install script at `scripts/install-bms.sh` (systemd + env file).
- Bookdarr connection wizard added after login (stores Bookdarr IP/port/API key in DB).
- Added auth secrets storage + UI settings, username-based login, and admin accounts tooling.
- Added login page, profile editor, and configurable Book Pool path in settings.
- Added file-based request/error logging and diagnostics push logging.
- Auto-generate JWT secrets on first run and provide admin-only rotation (no UI secret inputs).
- Fixed reader engine selection so Readium remains active when chosen (no reset to epub.js).
- Ebook stream endpoints now normalize content-type headers from Bookdarr (EPUB/PDF/audio) so Readium can open manifests.
- Library stream URLs now include the original filename/extension to help Readium detect EPUBs.
- Library cache version bumped to refresh stored stream URLs after update.
- Readium manifest fetch now retries once after auth refresh to handle expired access tokens.
- Readium manifest fetch also refreshes book detail once to update stale stream URLs.
- Readium now forces its base URL to /readium so resource links don't 404 under /pub.
- Readium requests hitting /pub are now proxied to the Readium server.
- Readium manifest link lists are normalized to arrays to avoid crashes when a single link is returned.
- Readium manifests now force local origin for stream URLs to prevent 502s when using public hostnames.
- Readium manifest URLs now use a local internal base (127.0.0.1) to bypass proxy 502s on public domains.

- Legacy epub.js reader is now behind a Reader Compatibility settings toggle.

## Decisions
- Stack: Node.js + NestJS
- Accounts: BMS‑only accounts, invite codes
- SMTP: Gmail via app password
- Bookdarr integration: API key stored in BMS settings UI (server‑side only)
- UI: web app on port 9797
- Target OS: Ubuntu until Docker
- Diagnostics: required during development; opt‑in later behind secret unlock

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Persist auth storage (DB), add rate limiting and account management.
2. Admin UI placeholder (simple web UI or API endpoints for settings).
3. Bookdarr client module (read‑only Book Pool endpoints).
4. Lock down diagnostics endpoint once auth exists.

## Notes
- BMS must never expose Bookdarr API key.
- BMS should not modify Bookdarr data (read‑only).
- Version bump rule: one GitHub push = increment patch (x.x.n+1) in `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- VM deploy uses the SSH host alias and key: `ssh bms-vm "git -C /opt/bookdarr-media-server pull --ff-only; npm --prefix /opt/bookdarr-media-server ci; npm --prefix /opt/bookdarr-media-server run build; sudo systemctl restart bookdarr-media-server"`
